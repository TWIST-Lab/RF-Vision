# RF-Vision: Object Characterization using Radio Frequency Propagation in Wireless Digital Twin

This codebase facilitates the experiments done for Object Chracterization.

## Introduction

In this exp, we introduce a novel approach for object characterization using Radio Frequency (RF) propagation map generation through ray-tracing within a Digital Twin (DT) framework. We outline a systematic pipeline for leveraging NVIDIA's Sionna Ray-Tracing tool to generate DT propagation maps created in Blender for indoor environments.
